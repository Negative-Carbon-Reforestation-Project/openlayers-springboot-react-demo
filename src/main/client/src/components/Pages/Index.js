                        <h2>Why is reforestation important?</h2>
                        <p>Forests play an important role in balancing our ecosystem. They are responsible for reducing carbon levels in our atmosphere and providing an environment for a diverse group of plants and animals to thrive in. Unfortunately, they are being destroyed or damaged due to various reasons on a daily basis â€“ disturbing not only the local biodiversity of the area but all of us.</p>
                        <p>Reforestation is the process of regenerating or replanting forest areas that have been destroyed or damaged. Even though forests have the capability to self-regenerate via the dispersion of seeds, forest lands that have been badly damaged cannot be regenerated unless aided through native methods such as planting new trees.</p>
                        <p>We at <abbr>NCRP</abbr> are committed to aiding the people who are directly involved in reforestation efforts in Washington.</p>
